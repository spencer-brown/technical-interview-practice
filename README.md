# Technical Interview Practice

This project contains a number of practice problems/data structures I've solved/created while studying for technical interviews.

Some CTCI solutions have been tested, others have just been typed up after I've written/whiteboarded them.

I might come back to these later to refine them and/or test them properly, but I might just leave them here as-is :P. I figured it would be cool just to document/publish them.
